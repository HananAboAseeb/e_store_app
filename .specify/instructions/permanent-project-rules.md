# Permanent Project Rules (SpecKit Mandatory Rules)

These 12 rules apply to every feature in this repository without exception:

1. **Verification Timing**: Do NOT run `flutter analyze` or `flutter test` after each individual task. Save all static analysis and verification strictly for the final phase to save tokens and time.
2. **Asset Policy**: Do NOT generate any new placeholder images, icons, or asset files. Reuse existing assets located in `assets/images/` and `assets/design_references/` only. Use provided Figma screenshots strictly as visual references.
3. **Architectural Adherence**: STRICTLY adhere to the project Constitution, Feature-First Clean Architecture, Design Tokens (`app_colors`, `app_spacing`, `app_typography`, `app_theme`), and all established coding standards.
4. **Code Quality & Design Patterns**: Write clean, production-ready Dart code using proper Design Patterns (Repository, UseCase, Cubit/Bloc, Factory for models, etc.). Extract all reusable UI components into separate widget files.
5. **Dimensions & Frameworks**: All dimensions must use `flutter_screenutil` (`.w`, `.h`, `.r`, `.sp`). All navigation must use `go_router`. All state management must use `flutter_bloc` (Cubit) with `equatable` states.
6. **Component Reuse**: Reuse existing shared widgets and components from previous features (e.g., DiscountBadge, ShopProductCard, PrimaryButton, etc.) whenever applicable.
7. **Clean Architecture Layers**: Every feature must include: Domain (entities, repository contract, usecases), Data (models, mock datasource, repository impl with `safeCall`), Presentation (cubit, state, pages, widgets), DI registration, and routing.
8. **Phase 1 Data Scope**: Mock Data only in Phase 1 (no real API).
9. **Loading Experience**: Shimmer placeholders for all loading states.
10. **Visual Perfection**: Pixel-perfect match with the Figma screenshots (colors, spacing, radius, typography).
11. **STRICT COLOR & TOKEN ENFORCEMENT**: All colors, spacing, and typography must reference tokens from `AppColors`, `AppSpacing`, and `AppTypography`. No hardcoded values are allowed. If a token is missing, add it to the tokens file first.
12. **CLI & THEME ENVIRONMENT COMPATIBILITY**: The project is compatible across both local Flutter (3.24.5) and newer Flutter toolchains. The theme in `app_theme.dart` and `component_themes.dart` is designed to be version-agnostic (avoiding version-incompatible APIs such as `CardTheme` vs `CardThemeData`). Do NOT re-introduce `CardThemeData` or `CardTheme` into `ThemeData` or `AppComponentThemes` to preserve seamless compilation and runtime execution on the user's Flutter environment.
